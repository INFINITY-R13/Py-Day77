## Learning Outcomes
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Create and manipulate NumPy arrays of any dimension
- Perform efficient array operations and mathematical computations
- Use advanced indexing and slicing techniques
- Work with image data using NumPy arrays
- Visualize data using Matplotlib
- Apply NumPy concepts to real-world data science problems

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow jupyter

# Launch JupyterLab
python -m jupyterlab

# Open: Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays.ipynb
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow jupyter`
2. Use Python 3.7 or higher
3. For Jupyter issues, try: `python -m jupyterlab` instead of `jupyter notebook`
4. Check that all imports work: `python -c "import numpy, matplotlib, scipy, PIL; print('All good!')"`
5. Verify notebook integrity: The notebook contains 90 cells and should load without errors
